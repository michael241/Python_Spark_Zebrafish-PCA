# Python_Spark_Zebrafish-PCA
Primary Component Analysis and Feature-Based Aggregation of Zebrafish neural activity
<br />
<br />
Motivation: Zebrafish are transparent fish, a quality that allows easy recording over its entire brain using a technique called light-sheet microscopy.  Analyzing this information requires primary component analysis(Part 3) and feature-based aggregation and primary component analysis (Part 4) in order to make the workload manageable.   
<br />
Installation: os, sys, pyspark, matplotlib, numpy, and mpl_toolkits.
